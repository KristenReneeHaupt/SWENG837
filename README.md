KRH_Sweng837_Final_Project

The combined document found under the Word folder titled SWENG837_Final_Project is the culmination of all of the images contained in the Images folder as well as a basic scipt for the video titled KRH_SWENG837_Final_Video.
The document begins by covering the Business Requirements and the Non functional requirements per the project description.

I chose to design my project based around Selection 6 in the Potential Projects section of the Key Guidelines for the project, which is a Generative AI-Powered Customer Service Chatbot.

After discussing the Business Requirements and the Non-Functional Requirements, I started the modelling section with the Use Case Diagram.

UML Use Case Diagram - This diagram shows how the actors relate to the case studies presented in the previous section.

UML Domain Model - There is a conceptual calls table and a pruning table presented before the Domain Model to show the path of thinking of how I got the information for the model.

UML Class Diagram - The class diagram expands on the domain model by defining attributes and methods.

UML Sequence Diagram - This diagram shows the entire sequence of an interaction of a customer with the chatbot as the use cases melt into each other.

UML State Diagram - Is a simplified way of looking at the termination points of the sequence diagram.

UML Swimlane Diagram - This shows the path from beginning to end of a customer interaction with the chatbot.

UML Component Diagram - This shows the interactions between the different components of the system.

Cloud Deployment Diagram - This shows the use of the blue-green method for rolling out updates to the model that allow the user to roll back to the proven method should a bug arise.

Tables Definitions - This defines the table definitions used for the SQL based database. 

I finished up by explaining the use of the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) design pattern. I didn't want to reinvent the wheel with this project. A simple interface and jargonless responses are what I was looking for here.
